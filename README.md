# Alert Stamping
As a part of my degree at Kent State University, I had to undergo a technical internship. My time at Alert Stamping was a part of my journey into the technical world, as I used to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Excel, and relational databases extensively.

## This Project
I improved Alert Stamping's website by creating a carousel to replace an old flash player animation.

## Implemented Live
You can access the results of this project in one of two places:
